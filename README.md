# Based Dinner

Randomly select a recipe from [based.cooking](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/based.cooking)

## Installation

I'm currently working on making a standalone binary of it. Version 0.1 coming up soon.

## Usage

Right now you can just run ```dinner.py``` with ```python``` on your terminal. Not efficient though.
